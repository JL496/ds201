    "1) Start the first cell with your last name, HW/Lab number, etc. For example, assignmentname_solutions_basnet.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3) To submit HW solutions, go to our course in Canvas --> Assignments --> HW 3 --> Submit Assignment --> Click \"Chose file\" --> choose HTML file you saved --> Click another file--> choose ipynb file--submit. Once you submit, download  and check to make sure that you have submitted the correct files.\n",
